# ManagmentSystem

My project contains two file login.py and Managment.py:

#First File login.py:

The login page allows a user to gain access to an application by entering their username and password or if you are new User you can do registration.

A user navigates to an application and is presented with a login page as a way to gain access to the application. There are three possible results:

    1) Authentication is successful and the user is directed to the application landing page.
    2) Authentication fails and the user remains on the login page. If authentication fails, the screen should show an informational or error message about the failure.
    3) if you are new user you can do register your self.
